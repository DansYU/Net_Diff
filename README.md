# Net_Diff

Net_Diff is a software for GNSS Download, Positioning and Analysis.

It supports functions of SPP/PPP/DSPP/DPPP/RTK/PPP-RTK, it can also applied in SPP/PPP with BeiDou augmentation information.

It supports data analysis, including coordinate plotting, positioning error comparison, satellite number, PDOP, satellite skyview, satellite visibility, cycleslip, troposphere, ionosphere, observation minus correction, positioning residuals and so on.
 
It provides IGS data and products download.

It also provides some useful tools such as time and coordinate system transfer, RINEX edit.

## How to install:
 1. Install gzip
   
        Click gzip-1.3.12-1-setup.exe and install gzip. 
      
        For example, after install it, gzip.exe is under C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\
  
 2. Instal Net_Diff
 
    *a) If you have installed MATLAB or MATLAB Runtime version 9.2 (R2017a) in your computer.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution_files_only/ and click Net_Diff.exe
      
    *b) If not.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution/ and click Net_Diff_Installer_web.exe to install MATLAB Runtime and Net_Diff.exe
     
        Please keep your computer connected to internet while installing.
        
        It will take a few minutes to download MATLAB Runtime, please be patient.
        
        After finish installing, you can find the execute file from the installed program directory, like C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\. 
      
        !!!!!!!If your Windows OS is under C:\, Net_Diff may canâ€™t read and write files under C:\. In this case, it is recommended to copy C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\ to other drive!!!!!!!!!
      
  3. Complete Full Installation
  
    Copy C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\gzip.exe to the directory of Net_Diff GUI.

***
* When use the software, please open it from execute file, not from Windows Start.    

* As for the use of Net_Diff, please refer to the guide document "A guide to use Net_Diff.pdf".

* Source code is under the src branch.
