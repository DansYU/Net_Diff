        For example, after install it, gzip.exe is under C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\
  
 2. Install Net_Diff
 
    *a) If you have installed MATLAB R2017a or MATLAB Runtime version 9.2 (R2017a) in your computer.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution_files_only/ and click Net_Diff.exe
      
    *b) If not.*
   
        Open /for_redistribution/ and click Net_Diff_Installer_web.exe to install MATLAB Runtime and Net_Diff.exe
     
        Please keep your computer connected to internet while installing.
        
        It will take a few minutes to download MATLAB Runtime, please be patient.
        
        If error occurs in downloading MATLAB Runtime 9.2, please download or update it by hand from:        
        https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
        
        After finish installing, you can find the execute file from the installed program directory, like C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\. 
      
        !!!!!!!If your Windows OS is under C:\, Net_Diff may canâ€™t read and write files under C:\. In this case, it is recommended to copy C:\Program Files\Net_Diff\application\ to other drive!!!!!!!!!
      
  3. Complete Full Installation
  
    Copy C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\gzip.exe to the directory of Net_Diff GUI.
