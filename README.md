# Net_Diff
Net_Diff is a software for GNSS Download, Positioning and Analysis.

This branch is the source code of Net_Diff, which can be used for debugging if some errors occurs while using GUI, or for furthuer research.

To use this program:
 
1). Add the source code to a new solution of your Visual Studio, and then compile it. If you don't have a Visual Forttran compiler in you Visual Studio, you need to install one: https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers

2). Specify your woking directory in Control.txt, which is generated by Net_Diff GUI. Or copy the Control.txt to your current solution working directory.

3). Start debug.
